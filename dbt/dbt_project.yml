#This setting configures the profile that dbt will use for this project. When you invoke dbt from the command
#line, dbt parses your dbt_project.yml and obtains the profile name, which dbt needs to connect to your
#data warehouse. dbt checks your profile.yml file for a profile within the same name. 
#A profile contains all the details needed to connect to your data warehouse. Hence, the name in 
#your profile.yml file is the name you will specify here, profile: 'name'
profile: 'Fakestore'

#This configurations specify where dbt should look for different types of files. 
#The source-paths configuration, for example, states that models in this project can be found in the
# "models/" directory.
